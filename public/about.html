    <p>Ahem, your probably wondering "Nox wtf is this shi-" and to that I say "Stfu before I rip your mouth-" I mean this is a website I'm making for fun! Because I'm bored so, you could say its <a href="https://github.com/Nwko/Bored">Bored</a> V.2.0 but we don't talk about Bored since I'm to lazy to actually work on it ;)</p>
    <p>If you have anymore questions just send it over to <strong>example@gmail.com</strong> where I'll totally read them and not mark as spam cause I'm to lazy to reply back :D Though if you really have some questions Nox#4350 on discord or alexanderisasimp4anime@gmail.com .w.</p>
