        <p>Mannn I'm so, bored</p>
        <p>
          Ooo I just figured out why I don't see the footer it's because I'm
          dumb :D

        <p>No but seriously it's cause of</p>
        <code
          >.footer margin-top: 20px font-size: 12px color:
          $secondary-color-random a color: $link-color-random &:hover color:
          $hover-color-random
        </code>
        <p>
          But for the you dumb one's basically since the text color is the same
          as the background of the page you can't see it but when you hover over
          where it is the footer you can see it magic
          <sparkles>sparkles</sparkles> ya it looked way better in my head than
          reality pwp
        </p>
        <p>
          Hmm is this whole page just gonna be <strong>p</strong> element aka
          paragrpah's? @w@
